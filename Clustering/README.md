“Clustering” folder (divided into other subfolders for different locations) including 
clustering results, 
plots of metrics calculated to evaluate clustering quality, 
and plots of representative days of PV capacity factor, ambient temperature, zonal electricity prices and user energy demands.
Run the "scenario_generation" function (second section of the software interface "main.py") to obtain the clustering results.
Run the "post_clustering" function (third section of the software interface "main.py") to obtain the price timeseries classified into a fixed “best” number of clusters, as well as the representative days for PV capacity factor, ambient temperature, zonal electricity prices and user energy demands.
