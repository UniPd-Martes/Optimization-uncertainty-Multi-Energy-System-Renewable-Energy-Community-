Run the "clustering_design_operation" function (fourth section of the software interface "main.py") to obtain the optimal clustering-based design solutions.
Run the "fullts_operation" function (fifth section of the software interface "main.py") to validate and test the “best” clustering-based design solutions against full timeseries of a historical testing dataset.
